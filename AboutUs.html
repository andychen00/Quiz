          and franchised a total of 18,625 restaurants worldwide in 2020. The
          vast majority of these were franchised- 18,573, to be precise. Only 52

          alot of physical store. From several ratings of existing fast food
          restaurants, it turns out that Burger King is only able to be in 10th
